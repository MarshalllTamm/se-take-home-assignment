Could add queue to use

Im taking data structure and algorithm this semester and have just come to queue so probably can use that.

Searched how to set timer, shift and unshift an array, splicing an array

if(order length !== 0)

if bot is added check for the currently processing

if empty then push the first element of the order

if bot deleted target the processing element to remove it
(find the element)

if done processing (find and remove)

check for currently processing and compare with the orders if not inside then push (store the value we push for reference)

if(order length !== 0)

    outer loop that executes once

    set interval executes again after the process succeed

order come in trigger the bot to execute this function
